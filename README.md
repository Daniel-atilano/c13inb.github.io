## Introduction to MRI-lab: The Survival Kit  


Hyde is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.


## Wiki MRIlab  
A [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) is a website on which users collaboratively modify content and structure directly from the web browser. Thus, our MRI-Wiki aim is to maintain updated content for the cluster usage, MRI analysis and other computational tools of interest.  
This wiki is made and updated by all the members of the MRIlab and for all of us.


## External tutorials
